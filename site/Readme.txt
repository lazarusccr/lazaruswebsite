Introduction
---------------

This is a script which is written by me, Adnan Shameem (Sunny) for Lazarus Homepage. This was a mockup which gradually was coded to this script to work as a prototype. During the making of this project forum members helped me with suggestions and ideas. I am grateful to them.

Hope to see Lazarus as one of the top IDEs of the world.
