<h1 class="title">Why use Lazarus?</h1>

<p>Lazarus is a versatile IDE with many features. There are many reasons why Lazarus could be chosen over other IDEs:</p>

<h2>Lazarus is Cross platform</h2>

<p>There are many IDEs available for free and commercial as well. But a very few can support the platforms supported by Lazarus. Lazarus can be run in Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, BSD, Raspberry Pi etc. It gives similar programing experience in all of the platforms.</p>

<h2>Get started right away</h2>

<p>Only installing Lazarus gives you basic features to get you started. When installed, Lazarus is ready to create anything from console to graphical applications. Lazarus has a built-in drag and drop form designer which cleverly integrates with your code. You also get Free Pascal Manuals, example codes, debugger, fpDoc documentation utility and much more with the default installation. Lazarus can be a stress-free solution for you.</p>

<h2>No dependencies!</h2>

<p>With Lazarus you can create programs which does not require any platform dependencies (unless you use any). The result of it is the user of your program does not need to install any further packages, libraries or frameworks to run your software.</p>

<h2>Easier Language</h2>

<p>Lazarus uses Free Pascal as its language to code. In fact Lazarus is the best IDE for Free Pascal. Free Pascal is an Object Pascal derivative of Pascal. Pascal was designed for educating computer science students to learn programing easily. The syntax which is well formed and easier to understand can benefit you greatly in your programing.</p>

<h2>Can be used in commercial projects</h2>

<p>Some IDEs restrict their license to only non-commercial development. Lazarus is GPL/LGPL which permits using it in building commercial projects.</p>
