<h1 class="title">Features</h1>
<p>Lazarus is packed with features that might satisfy you:<p>

	<div class="fblock">
		<h1>Freedom</h1>
		<h2>Simple, compatible performance</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Everything necessary to get started is <strong>installed by default</strong></li>
			<li>Your program stays <strong>compatible to major (and minor) platforms</strong> (Windows, MacOS, Linux, BSD &amp; more)</li>
			<li>Make modifications, rename components and <strong>Lazarus will update the code automatically</strong></li>
			<li>Share the same code with anyone. Static linking would let them <strong>compile easily, no matter what platform they use</strong></li>
			<li>GPL license allows you to <strong>make commercial apps</strong> or do whatever you feel doing!</li>
			</ul>
		</ul>
	</div>

	<div class="fblock">
		<h1>Peace</h1>
		<h2>Easy, uniform <br/>experience</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Easy <strong>Drag &amp; Drop Form designer</strong></li>
			<li><strong>Components have the same behavior</strong> on different platforms</li>
			<li><strong>Develop and code your program the same way</strong> between platforms</li>
			<li><strong>Uniform looking forms</strong> throughout platforms</li>
			<li>No fuss for users</li>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>No platform dependencies</strong></li>
			<li><strong>No frameworks or virtual machines</strong> (unless you want to use them)</li>

		</ul>
	</div>

	<div class="fblock">
		<h1>Creativity</h1>
		<h2>Modern, customizable productivity</h2>
		<ul>

<h2>Cross Platform</h2>
<p>Lazarus runs on Windows, MacOS, Linux and many other platforms. Even on Raspberry Pi! The programs you create also runs on these platforms. Enjoy the same experience on your favorite OS. See <a href="http://wiki.freepascal.org/Installing_Lazarus">Installing Lazarus</a> for OS-specific instructions for installation.</p>

<h2>Powerful, Fast</h2>
<p>Lazarus compiles, loads and performs faster than its commercial alternative. Its compiler FPC is being constantly developed to improve performance. Lazarus is a capable IDE for handling large projects. Lazarus is made by Lazarus itself. So you can guess.</p>

<h2>Drag and Drop Form Designer</h2>
<p>Lazarus has a graphical form designer with guidelines for aligning with adjucent components. There are numerous components for almost every software imaginable, already ready to be used. Further components can be added to the IDE by Lazarus Package Files (LPKs).</p>

<h2>Easily deployable</h2>
<p>If you are tired of installing frameworks, so are we. Lazarus links the libraries statically. Which means your executable file does not need any dll files or frameworks to run, unless you want to use them.</p>

<h2>Cross-platform but uniform experience</h2>
<p>Lazarus form designer uses LCL (Lazarus Component Library) which is especially designed for cross platform performance in mind. Give your users an uniform experience in all platforms.</p>

<h2>Modern, Object oriented language</h2>
<p>Lazarus uses Free Pascal as its language which is an Object Pascal dialect. It is an Object oriented High level language which is very appropriate for cross-platform compiling.</p>

<h2>Human readable coding style</h2>
<p>Programing Languages can be hard to read. Free Pascal is a language which heavily uses dictionary words, such as begin, end, uses, interface, implementation, read, write etc. which makes codes easily readable and understandable.</p>

<h2>Light on space</h2>
<p>Executables made with Lazarus have no dependencies which frees you from installing huge frameworks and virtual machines. That lets you store more of your stuff rather than just struggle for the software.</p>

<h2>Easily Extendable</h2>
<p>Hundreds of developers are developing and maintaining their Lazarus Libraries and Lazarus Packages (LPKs). You can find almost any kind of library that you may need.</p>

<h2>Open source, fear free</h2>
<p>Lazarus is open source and LGPL/GPL, which is fearless. So you can create non-commercial and commercial applications with it.</p>

<h2>Frameworks</h2>
<p>Various Frameworks are available which saves your time on certain codebase.</p>
